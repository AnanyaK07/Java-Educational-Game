Intro:

Gastrointestinal (GI) tract:
A system of organs within the human body responsible for the digestion 
and absorption of food and the elimination of waste products. 
It begins at the mouth, where food enters the body, and ends at the anus, 
where waste products are expelled.

Mechanical Digestion:
The process of physically breaking down food into 
smaller particles to increase its surface area for chemical digestion 
(ex: chewing food).

Chemical Digestion: 
The process by which large food molecules are 
broken down into smaller, simpler molecules by enzymes and other
digestive chemicals. (ex: stomach acid)


Mouth:

System: 
Digestive

Structure: 
The first part of the digestive tract; where food intake happens. 
It connects to the esophagus. 

Function: 
Food gets mechanically digested by the teeth and chemically 
digested by salivary amylase in the saliva.

Extra Info:
Saliva: 
A fluid produced by glands in the mouth to digest and help digest
food. Contains salivary amylase.

Salivary Amylase: 
An enzyme produced by the salivary glands in the mouth. 
When food enters the mouth, salivary glands release saliva, 
which contains salivary amylase. Salivary amylase begins the process of 
carbohydrate digestion by breaking down complex carbohydrates such as 
starches into simpler sugars.


Pharynx:

System: 
Digestive and Respiratory

Structure: 
A muscular tube that connects the nasal cavity and mouth to 
the esophagus and larynx. 

Function: 
Commonly known as the throat, it plays a vital role in both 
the respiratory and digestive systems.


Esophagus: 

System: 
Digestive

Function: 
Carries food from the mouth to the stomach using wave-like 
contractions called peristalsis.

Extra Info:
Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES): 
A sphincter muscle (ring shaped muscle that 
relaxes or tightens to open or close a passage or opening in the body) 
that is used to prevent chyme from going back up the esophagus. 
If it does go up, heart burns will occur.

Heartburn/Acid Reflux: 
When the LES becomes weakened or relaxes 
inappropriately, stomach acid and acidic chyme can go back up 
the esophagus causing pain to the chest area. 


Stomach:

System: 
Digestive

Structure: 
This is after the esophagus and Esophageal Sphincter

Function: 
Mucus lining protects the stomach from the acidic environment.
Secretes hydrogen chloride or (HCI) so that the pH level of the stomach 
can be maintained at 2.

Mechanical digestion: 
Peristalsis move food further down the digestive 
tract, is used to break down the food into smaller pieces.

Chemical digestion: 
Due to the HCI (stomach acids) pepsinogen converts 
to its active form of pepsin which breaks down proteins. 
Chyme is produced when stomach acid mixes with the broken down food.

Extra Info:
Peristalsis: 
The wave-like movement in the GI of smooth muscles which 
move food further down the digestive tract.

Chyme: 
An acidic fluid made up of gastric juices and partially digested 
food that travels from the stomach to the small intestine.

Pyloric Sphincter: 
A sphincter muscle that allows chyme to exit the 
stomach so that it can enter the small intestine.

Peptic ulcer: 
A sore that may develop in your stomach, esophagus, 
or small intestine. Results from damaging of the lining from stomach 
acid, or excessive drinking, smoking, etc. 


Pancreas:

System: 
Digestive & Endocrine

Function: 
Creates pancreatic enzymes which break down ALL biomolecules 
through chemical digestion in the small instestine. Creates sodium 
bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid. Also creates hormones 
insulin and glucagon to regulate blood sugar levels.

Extra Info:
Insulin: 
It works to lower the blood sugar levels by facilitating the 
storage of extra glucose from the blood into the liver and into the
muscle tissues in the form of glycogen.

Glucagon: 
One of the primary functions of glucagon is to raise blood glucose 
levels by stimulating the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream. 

Sodium Bicarbonate: 
Created in the pancreas. 
Part of the pancreatic juice that enters the small intestine. The
main function is to neutralize stomach acid in the smaller intestine. 


Liver:

System: 
Digestive & Endocrine

Structure: 
Looks like a pouch.

Function: 
Produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder. Also helps 
regulate blood sugar levels by storing excess glucose as glycogen into 
the bloodstream when necessary.

Extra Info:
Bile: 
Fluid produced by the liver (and stored in the gallbladder). 
It breaks down lipids in the small intestine.

Glycogen: 
Stored form of glucose and used for energy.


Gallbladder:

System: 
Digestive

Function: 
It stores bile, which was produced by the liver.
Releases it into the duodenum when needed.

Extra Info:
Duodenum: 
First part of the small intestine. 
Further digests the chyme so it can be easily absorbed in the small 
intestine. Does digest some nutrients and water for the body to use. 


Small Intestine:

System:
Digestive

Structure: 
Noodle-like structure that wraps around itself. 

Function: 
Where the most digestion occurs. Gets sodium bicarbonate and pancreatic 
enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the gallbladder/liver.

Mechanical digestion: 
Bile breaks down lipid, peristalsis breaks down foods

Chemical digestions: 
The enzymes received from the pancreas breaks 
down the carbs, lipids, and proteins. The villi absorbs nutrients by 
increasing the surface area of the small intestine.

Extra Info:
Villi/Villus: 
Tiny hair-like structures that line the inside of the small 
intestine. Increases the surface area of the small intestine so that 
nutrients can be absorbed. 


Large Intestine:

System: 
Digestive 

Structure: 
Looks like a long line of sausages.

Function: 
Also known as the colon, it's reponsible for reabsorbing water 
into the body from the remaining undigested food. Also houses a large 
population of beneficial bacteria that aid in digestion and produce vitamins B & K.

Extra Info:
Diarrhea: 
A common condition characterized by frequent, loose, or 
watery bowel movements. It occurs when the intestines fail to properly 
absorb water, resulting in an increased volume of stool and a more 
liquid consistency.

Constapation: 
When the large intestine absorbs too much water from feces. 
This can cause fewer bowel movements than usual, and they can 
be more difficult and painful.


Spleen:

System: 
Immune & Circulatory

Function: 
The spleen acts as a blood filter, removing abnormal or damaged 
red blood cells and platelets from circulation. It also creates white
blood cells.


Cecum:

System: 
Digestive

Structure: 
In herbivores (pigs), the cecum is a structure between 
the large and small intestine. In humans, it is the first part of the 
large intestine from which the appendix arises to the side. 

Function: 
In herbivores (pigs), the bacteria present produce cellulase, an enzyme, 
which breaks down cellulose. Humans do not have this bacteria in their 
cecum, so they cannot break down cellulose. The appendix is used to make
antibodies which is used for the immune system.

Extra Info:
Appendicitis: 
A condition characterized by inflammation of the appendix. 
Appendicitis is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and t
reatment to prevent complications such as a ruptured appendix, which can 
lead to serious infection and even death if left untreated.

Rectum: 
A muscular organ, located at the end of the large intestine, 
just before the anus. It serves as the final portion of the digestive 
tract, where feces are stored before they are expelled from the body.


Anus:

System: 
Digestive

Function: 
The opening at the end of the digestive tract through which 
feces are expelled from the body.

Extra Info:
Feces: 
The waste material that is eliminated from the body through the 
rectum and anus. It consists of undigested food residues, water, 
bacteria, and other metabolic waste products.


Umbilical Vein:

System: 
Circulatory

Function: 
A blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood from the 
placenta to the fetus during pregnancy. It is one of the three main 
blood vessels contained within the umbilical cord, which connects the 
developing fetus to the placenta in the womb.


Urogenital Opening:

System: 
Excretory & Reproductive

Function: 
External opening of the urogenital system in vertebrates, 
including humans. In males it serves as an exit point for urine and semen.
In women it serves as an exit point for urine and menustrual fluid.


Urogenital Papilla:

System: 
Excretory & Reproductive

Structure: 
It is a small, fleshy protrusion located near the anus and ventral 
to the tail. 

Function: 
A structure found in some vertebrates, particularly in female mammals. 
Plays a role in reproductive and urinary processes, 
facilitating mating, childbirth, and/or urination, depending on the 
species' reproductive and anatomical characteristics. In female pigs, 
it releases a gas called pheromones, which signals to the male pigs that
they are ready to mate.
