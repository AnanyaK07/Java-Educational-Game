Intro:

Thoracic/Chest Cavity: 
The space inside your chest that contains the 
heart, lungs, and other organs + tissues. Second biggest hollow space 
in your body

Respiration: 
The process of getting oxygen for your body and removing
carbon dioxide from your body. 


Diaphragm:

System: 
Respiratory

Structure: 
A dome-shaped muscle that separates the thoracic cavity 
(containing the heart and lungs) from the abdominal cavity (containing 
the digestive organs).

Function: 
It is a crucial muscle involved in the process of breathing. 

Inhalation (Breathing In): When you breathe in, your diaphragm contracts 
and moves downward. This increases the space in your chest cavity and 
decreases the pressure inside the chest, relative to the outside air. 

Exhalation: (Breathing Out): When you breathe out, your diaphragm 
relaxes and moves upward into its dome-shaped resting position. This 
decreases the space in the chest cavity and increases the pressure 
in the chest, pushing air out of the lungs.


Lungs (Left):

System: 
Respiratory

Structure: 
Its on the body's right side (other person's view).

Function: 
Their primary function is to facilitate the exchange of 
oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and the bloodstream.
 
Air from the outside environment flows into the lungs through the nose or
mouth, passing the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and finally into the 
bronchi and smaller bronchioles, ending in the alveoli (tiny air 
sacs where gas exchange occurs) to equalize the pressure.
	  
Air Goes Back Out: The air that was in your lungs goes back up the 
windpipe and out through your mouth or nose, leaving your body.

Extra Info:
Alveoli: 
Air sacs in the lungs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon 
dioxide happens. When oxygen gets inhaled it goes through the lungs’ 
alveoli and into the bloodstream, and when carbon dioxide gets exhaled 
it goes from the bloodstream, through the alveoli, and out of the lungs.

Pneumonia: 
Pneumonia is an infection that damages the air sacs (alveoli) 
in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing 
symptoms such as cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty 
breathing. Various organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, 
can cause pneumonia.

Emphysema: 
Emphysema is a long-term, progressive disease of the lungs 
that primarily causes shortness of breath due to the over-inflation 
(swelling) of the alveoli (air sacs in the lungs). In people with emphysema, 
the lung tissue involved in exchange of gasses (oxygen and carbon dioxide) 
is impaired or destroyed. It is most often caused by long-term exposure 
to airborne irritants, including tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical 
fumes, and dust.

it goes from the bloodstream, through the alveoli, and out of the lungs.

Pneumonia: 
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs (alveoli) 
in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing 
symptoms such as cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty 
breathing. Various organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi,

Heart:

System: 
Circulatory

Structure: 
The heart has four chambers.

Function: 
Pumps blood all throughout the body. This process ensures that 
oxygen and nutrients are delivered to all cells, tissues, and organs, 
while waste products, such as carbon dioxide, are removed. The heart 
accomplishes this through its rhythmic contractions, which create pressure 
that drives the circulation of blood through the arteries, capillaries, 
and veins.

Extra Info:
Heart Attack: 
A heart attack happens when the blood flow that brings oxygen 
to the heart muscle is severely reduced or cut off completely. This can 
happen because the coronary artery, that supplies the heart with blood, gets blocked 
by plaque. Without enough oxygen, the heart muscle can 
be damaged.

Atherosclerosis: 
Imagine your body's arteries are like pipes that carry 
blood from your heart to the rest of your body. Atherosclerosis happens 
when these pipes get clogged up with fatty deposits, making it harder 
for blood to flow through.

Sudden Cardiac Arrest: 
This is an electrical problem in your heart. 
It suddenly stops beating properly, which means blood can't get to the 
brain, lungs, and other organs. It's an emergency that needs to be fixed 
right away, or it can lead to death within minutes.

Stroke: 
A stroke occurs when part of your brain doesn't get the blood and 
oxygen it needs, either because a blood vessel is blocked 
(which is called an ischemic stroke) or because a blood vessel in the 
brain bursts (called a hemorrhagic stroke). This can cause brain cells to 
be damaged or die, affecting how the body works or how you move, speak, 
and think.
	
	- Ischemic Stroke: This term is used to describe something that 
	happens because not enough blood is getting to a part of the body. The 
	most common example is an ischemic stroke, where there is a blood clot, 
	which stops blood from reaching parts of the brain.
	
	- Hemorrhagic Stroke: This refers to bleeding or a burst blood vessel.
	In the context of strokes, a hemorrhagic stroke happens when a 
	blood vessel in the brain breaks open, causing bleeding inside the brain. 
	This can damage brain cells and cause serious health problems.
	

Thymus Glands:

System: 
Endocrine

Structure: 
It is located in the chest cavity on either side of the thyroid gland.

Function: 
It produces the hormone Thymosin which helps to mature the immune system cells.


Thymus Tissue:

System: 
Immune

Structure: 
It is located just above (anterior to) the heart. 

Function: 
It is involved in maturation of a type of white blood cells called T-cells.


Thyroid Glands:

System: 
Endocrine

Structure: 
The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland located 
in the front of the neck, just below Adam’s apple.

Function:  
It plays a crucial role in regulating various metabolic processes 
throughout the body through the production and secretion of thyroid hormones.

	- The thyroid gland produces two primary hormones: thyroxine (T4) 
	  and triiodothyronine (T3). 
	  
	- These hormones regulate metabolism, specifically by increasing the 
	  rate of cellular respiration.

Extra Info:
An underactive thyroid would cause hypothyroidism. The symptoms include 
weight gain and low energy.
An overactive thyroid would cause hyperthyroidism. The symptoms include 
weight loss and fatigue.


Trachea:

System: 
Respiratory

Structure: 
The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is a tubular structure 
that forms part of the respiratory system. It extends from the larynx 
(voice box) to the bronchi, which are the two main airways that lead 
into the lungs. 

Function: 
The trachea serves as a conduit for air to pass between the upper 
respiratory tract (nose and mouth) and the lungs. Supported by cartilage 
which gives the trachea its strong structure. The trachea is lined with 
mucus which is important because it traps particles. The mucus traps dust, 
germs, and other foreign particles that have been inhaled, preventing them 
from getting deeper into your lungs. Cilia are used to remove the mucus 
and trapped particles up the trachea. The continuous movement of mucus 
upwards keeps the air passages clean and clear, which is essential for 
efficient gas exchange in the lungs.

Extra Info:
When the function of the cilia is impaired (damaged), such as from smoking 
or certain diseases, the efficiency of this cleaning system is reduced, 
increasing the risk of infections and respiratory conditions.

Cilia: 
Hair like projections, specialized organelle. Provides force needed 
so that it can push foreign materials out of the respiratory system and 
into the digestive. 

Mucus: 
Protects lung and other organs from substances that may 
otherwise destroy it.

Bronchi: 
The bronchi are the main airways/tubes in the respiratory system 
that lead from the trachea (windpipe) into the lungs. They serve as conduits 
air to travel between the trachea and the lungs, facilitating the exchange 
of oxygen and carbon dioxide during respiration.

Bronchioles: 
Bronchioles are small airway branches within the lungs that 
arise from the bronchi, further dividing and branching into even smaller 
air passages known as terminal bronchioles. They represent the smallest 
conducting airways in the respiratory system before transitioning into 
the respiratory zone structures, such as alveoli, where gas exchange 
occurs.

Asthma: 
Asthma is a chronic (long-term) inflammatory disease of the 
airways that causes periodic episodes of wheezing (hard breathing), 
breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms occur 
due to the narrowing of the airways and an increase in mucus production, 
which can be triggered by various factors, including allergens 
(like pollen), exercise, cold air, or stress. Smooth muscles surrounding 
the bronchioles spasm constrict the passageway of air.

Bronchitis: 
Inflammation of the lining of bronchial tubes 
(which carry air to and from the lungs): can be caused by viruses.


Larynx:

System: 
Respiratory

Structure: 
The larynx, commonly referred to as the voice box, is a structure 
located in the neck at the top of the trachea (windpipe) and below the 
pharynx (throat). 

Function: 
It serves several important functions in the respiratory and vocal 
systems. The larynx forms the entrance to the trachea and serves as a 
passageway for air to move between the pharynx and the trachea during breathing. 
The primary function of the larynx in speech is to produce sound. It 
contains vocal cords, which are highly elastic folds of tissue. 
Air moves through them to vibrate and produce sound. 
It's usually thicker in males.

Extra Info:
Laryngitis: 
Laryngitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the larynx. 
The most common cause of acute laryngitis is viral infections, such as 
the common cold or flu. These infections can cause inflammation of the 
larynx and lead to symptoms like hoarseness, coughing, and sore throat.


Pulmonary Artery:

System: 
Circulatory 

Function: 
The pulmonary artery is unique because it carries deoxygenated
blood to the lungs, unlike other arteries that typically carry oxygenated 
blood. It gets the deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle.
This blood has already circulated through the body and has delivered 
oxygen to tissues, picking up carbon dioxide and other waste products.


Pericardium:

System: 
Ciruclatory

Structure: Lubrication around the heart. 

Function: 
Mechanical protection for the 
heart. Reduces friction between heart and surrounding structures. Protects
the heart from coming intact with viruses, bacteria, etc.

Extra Info:
Hemoglobin: 
A type of protein in red blood cells. It carries the majority 
of oxygen from the lungs to cells, and carries carbon dioxide back to the 
lungs. The oxygen and carbon dioxide then enter/exit the lungs through 
the alveoli. One danger of vaping is how inhaled carbon monoxide can 
connect to hemoglobin and damage it.

Carbon Monoxide: 
Odorless, colorless, tasteless but dangerous gas
It reduces the blood’s ability to carry oxygen. It does this by taking
the place of oxygen on hemoglobin.

Nicotine: 
A stimulant drug that speeds up the messages traveling between 
the brain and the body. It raises your blood pressure and spikes your 
adrenaline which increases heart rate.


Pharynx:

System: 
Digestive and Respiratory

Structure: 
A muscular tube that connects the nasal cavity and mouth to 
the esophagus and larynx. 

Function: 
Commonly known as the throat, it plays a vital role in both 
the respiratory and digestive systems.


Coronary Artery:

System: 
Circulatory

Structure: 
Wraps around the outside of the heart.

Function: 
The artery's main function to supply oxygen-rich blood to the 
heart muscle itself. The heart, like any other organ, requires a constant 
supply of oxygen and nutrients to function properly. 
The coronary arteries play a vital role in ensuring that the heart 
receives the necessary blood supply.
